Today, on 3rd of November, two days before the election day, it has become evident that the democrats will lose the 2024 presidential election and Donald Trump will be elected as the 47th president of the United States. It seems that many, even seemingly smart organizations, have a hard time grasping the reality and - as concerning as it is - the reasons behind this outcome. 

I believe the reasons for the democrat’s inevitable defeat are evident and I will shortly outline them here, in no specific order.

# Two party system

The two-party system of the United States makes it difficult for democrats to provide a policy that is compelling to the majority. At the same time it allows Donald Trump to leverage the discontent of the right-leaning Americans, all the way from far right to moderate conservatives.

This is because the two-party system is not granular enough to capture the wide variety of political views that people currently hold. In Europe - and specifically in Finland, the political system I am most familiar with - it is typical to have many parties to choose from. For example in Finland, the 200 seats in the parliament are divided between 10 parties, the 4 of which constitute the current government. These parties and their representations are provided below:


| Party             	    | Political stance    	            | Representatives	    | Position   |
| --             	    | -    	            | --	    | --   |
| Finns Party               | Far right	                        |	46                    | Government |
| Christian Democrats       | Religious right                   |	5                    | Government |
| National Coalition Party  | Moderate right                    |   48                    | Government |
| Swedish People's Party	| Swedish speaking moderate right   |	10	                | Government |
| Centre Party              | Moderate right                    | 22                      | Opposition           |
| Social Democratic Party   | Moderate left                     | 43                      | Opposition           |
| Geen League               | Green left                        | 13                      | Opposition |
| Left Alliance             | Far left                          | 11                      | Opposition |
| Others                    | Misc                              | 2                     | Opposition |

The benefit of the multiparty system is that it allows people to choose the policy they actually want. For example, all of the most visible “woke” advocates are contained in the Green League and Left Alliance parties whereas the “antiestablishment” and - well - racist views are represented by Finns Party. This allows the moderate parties such as National Coalition Party and Social Democratic Party to detach themselves from the most heated “culture wars” and focus on the substance of politics.

At the same time in the US, democrats are trying to send a message to everyone left from the middle and clearly failing in this task. For example, the democrats have advocated for policies such as [student loan pardons](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/17/politics/biden-student-loan-forgiveness/index.html), [defunding the police](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/kfile-kamala-harris-praised-defund-the-police-movement-in-june-2020/index.html) and [providing tax-funded gender-affirming care for inmates](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/10/us/debate-trump-harris-fact-check/now-she-wants-to-do-transgender-operations-on-illegal-aliens-that-are-in-prison?smid=url-share). This leaves the democrats open to Trump’s attacks, who effectively uses these individual woke policies to paint the democrats as left extremists. At the same time democrats have provided unconditional support of 17 billion dollars to Israel in their war - in the lack of a better word - against Palestinians which alienates both the the American muslims and the left leaning voters.

The United States is the promised land for consumers with endless selection of different products and services to choose from. But somehow at the same time it is a third world country when it comes to available option for the voter. Why is it?

# Failure to provide a positive future

For a week or two after Kamala Harris was introduced as the democratic candidate, it seemed that democrats might actually have a chance and democrats were doing well on the polls as well. Now they are looking to loose the election. What happened? 

Somehow the democrats forgot what selling is all about: it is about providing a compelling - and emotional - message about the better future you are providing. We all know what Trump is promising and who he is standing for. We can argue if his policies are right but at least we know what they are. But what is the democrat’s solution to the decline of American blue collar workers? What is their answer to the feeling that woke sentiment has gone too far? What is their response to the already unemployed uneducated working man’s fear of immigrants taking away his last chances of ever finding a job? 

Nobody knows, because throughout their campaign democrats have not spoken a word to the people who vote for Trump and offered them an alternative. They should know that it useless to tell people that Trump is bad. Instead you have to tell them why you are good and why they should select you instead of him. 

# Reactive campaign

The values and promises of the democrats remain unclear because they have run an extremely passive campaign that has mostly consisted of them reacting to crude remarks of Donald Trump. Trump knows that every time he says something vulgar, the press will have to publish a story on it, which both gives him free advertising and makes democrats look reactive and weak. And he has taken the most of this dynamic. But it is totally useless for democrats to play high and mighty and judge Trump’s comments: it will not convert a single Trump advocate while the supporters of Harris know the language to be crude without democrats telling them so.

The only right response from the democrats would have been to brush off the Trumps provocations and focus on providing a better alternative. But for some reason, they have not done so.

# Kamala Harris and lack of charisma

It is difficult to provide a compelling alternative, however, when you lack the required charisma to do so. I am sorry to say this but it is true: the good beginning of the campaign excluded, Kamala Harris has failed to provide a single emotionally engaging speech about the better future ahead of us. At the same time - as sad as it is - along his racist slurs and crude language, Trump has managed to do so many times. What he promises may not be true or possible to accomplish, but at least he promises something better. 

Trump’s campaign slogan: “Make America great again” is excellent. But what even is Harris’ slogan? Is it “We are not going back”? Sure, but if not back then where, exactly, are we going? “A new way forward”? Okay, but is it even a good way to go to? A good slogan does not have to be realistic or even possible to accomplish. But is should state the direction. Martin Luther King Jr. knew that. Instead of saying “I have a plan”, he said “I have a dream”. The democrats should have a dream too, and tell it to the world.

# Weak social media presence

The democrat’s failure to provide emotionally engaging alternative is painfully evident when we compare the candidates feeds in X. As of today, on 3rd of November, most of the Harris’ posts contain the words “Donald Trump”. This is bad advertisting.

Have you seen Apple market it’s products by referencing Samsung? No, you have not and the reason is clear: if you have a superior product and superior brand, mentioning your competitors only weakens you. If you have something far better than the competitors, why would you give them free advertising? By acknowledging them you only end up lifting them up. By not acknowledging them you demonstrate that they are so insignificant that you don’t even think about them.

So what on earth is Kamala Harris´ campaign doing here? Why is he talking about Donald Trump instead of the better future she can lead her voters to?

# Sticking with Joe Biden

Democrats have already demonstrated to the world that their judgements is severely flawed by sticking with Joe Biden for so long. The inability of Joe Biden to run for second term was evident for the last two years for every single person in the whole world, except of himself and the democrats. If a party believes someone as cognitively impaired as Joe Biden can run for presidency, it is difficult to trust them with the steering wheel of the most powerful nation of the world. And even when the democrats finally managed to push Joe Biden aside, they have been unable to distinguish themselves from him although he is extremely unpopular among Americans.

# Ignoring the underlying problems

In this essay I have focused mostly on the rhetorical reasons for democrats inevitable loss. But even if they fixed all of the above-mentioned issues, they would still fail because they have not understood the underlying reasons for Trump’s success. The reasons are:

1. Increasing economic inequality, especially of ownership
2. Decreasing status of uneducated men
3. Disproportionate attention to social issues raised by the left

I will go through these issues in a separate essay because they deserve one. I will end by saying that Trump will not do anything to solve these problems - except for the last one - which will only exacerbate them, lead to even greater suffering of his supporters and polarise the U.S. politics even more. And he gets to do it because, incredible as it is, democrats have no idea how to win an election.
