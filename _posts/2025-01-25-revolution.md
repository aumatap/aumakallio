At this point it is evident that a revolution is inevitable. 

1. Capital inequality has risen -- or at this point exceeded -- pre first world war levels.
2. Policies such as New Deal are impossible because -- unlike ever before -- capital inequality is a global phenomenon that cannot be solved with national legislation but would require international co-ordination.
3. International institutions have always been weak and they will become even weaker due to insurgence of nationalist right and are unable to create legislation that would fix the problem

For this reason it is inevitable that capital inequality will continue to increase. And along with it will increase societal instability that will eventually lead to civil war. We have already seen first signs of this in the form of Capitol attack and murder of Brian Thompson. I am not encouraging anyone and I am not hoping for revolution. But it is clear to me that it is inevitable.
